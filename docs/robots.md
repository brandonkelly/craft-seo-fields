# Robots.txt
### Default
When you install the plugin, it enabled the robots.txt by default, using [this template](https://github.com/studioespresso/craft-seo-fields/blob/master/src/templates/_placeholder/_robots.twig).

Based on the environment you've set in your site's ``.env`` file, it will only allow indexing on `live` or `production` environments and block indexing on all others.

You can modify the template with your own enviroments, conditions and settings in the CP.


::: warning
Note that this will not stop Google from indexing your staging/dev site if and when someone else has a link to it. Always add another level of authentication to make sure Google can't index it.

### Multisite

By default, each site in your Craft install will get the same `robots.txt`. If you need the option to change these per site, you can add `"robotsPerSite" => true` to `config/seo-fields.php`.

With that set, refresh the robots settings page and you'll see a sites dropdown at the top so you can switch sites and save a robots.txt for each.

::: warning  Important
The plugin assumes that the handle of the `SEO Fields` field will be simply: __`seo`__. If it can't find that field, it won't output anything.

If you use a different handle for your field, simply copy [this file](https://github.com/studioespresso/craft-seo-fields/blob/master/src/config.php) to the `config` directory of your project and change the fieldhandle to your own.
